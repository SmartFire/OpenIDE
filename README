OpenIDE - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openide

OpenIDE is an easily extensible tool for developers. It ties together the terminal, text editor and the ability to build and optionally share your extensions. You can write scripts reacting to editor events, file system changes and more.

Extensions for OpenIDE can be written in any language. As long as the language understands stdin and stdout it's all good. There are three different types of extensions:

* Scripts (commands you can run from the terminal)
* Reactive scripts (scripts reacting to events)
* Language plugins (plugins handling language spesific issues)

Any of these can run other commands and publish it's own events. Scripts are created in a way that they are self documenting and prepared for auto completion.

The OpenIDE configuration points are kind of like your usual .git folder. A .OpenIDE folder will be placed on the root level of your workspace. This gives the ability use your extensions as a DSL for your workspaces. You can even commit your .OpenIDE folder to the git repository and check your development environment out with your source code. By using the profile support in OpenIDE several developers can work while all having their OpenIDE environment committed with the source code.
The structure of OpenIDE let's developers choose which extensions should be shared with the rest of the team and which extensions should be private to you.
